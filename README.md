# DataEngineering_Project_AWS_GlueNotebooks_Snowflake
In this project, data is extracted from an API, loaded to AWS S3, transformed via Glue Notebooks using PySpark (JSON to CSV), and auto-ingested to Snowflake via SnowPipe. Snowflake tables are used for analysis, replacing AWS Glue Crawler and Athena used in Reponame.
